Prototype checklist:
1. Add clone() method to the hierarchy of our objects
2. Design a registry that maintains a cache of prototypical object (We used map in the example)
3. Design API that allows to clone objects in factory and return the results
4. Use factory API instead of 'new' keyword to instantiate the objects.
