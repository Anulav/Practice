MarkerInterface

Interface with no methods. By implementing such interfaces we provide special
ability to our classes.

for example,

Serializable, Cloneable, RandomAccess

By implementing a Serializable interface the object of the class can be
returned to a stream.

By implementing a Cloneable interface the object of the class can be
cloned.

JVM looks for such interfaces and then allows those objects with the functionalities
as specified for that Marker interface.
