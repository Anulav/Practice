Arrays
Continuous group of homogenous elements. Can store primitive and objects. In java, Arrays are objects.
Index based iteration. Let say there be an array of name a.
 address of a[3] = address of a[0] + size of element(object or primitive data) * 3

Access is fast however the insertion and deletion from an array is time consuming.
Arrays are immutable i.e once memory provided at runtime it will not change with time.

All array elements have a property called length which tells the length of a given array.
