ExecutorFramework

Disadvantages of traditional thread creation:
1. Time consuming process
2. Poor Resource Management, if threads are not managed efficiently.
3. Not Robust, may keep on creating threads that can cause thread scarcity.

Introduction

Executor Framework(introduced in Java 1.5) gives a ThreadPool of worker threads. Which can be assigned a task. After completion
the thread is sent back to the pool for reassignment(re-use).

Executor Framework manages the entire lifecycle of the thread. It solves:
1. time consumption : by no need to create separate classes for threads.
2. Poor Resource Management: threads are "re-used"
3. Robustness : Even if a million requests are generated. It won't create a million threads as you can define an
upper bound for threads.

Different type of thread pools:

Single Thread Executor : A thread pool with only one thread. So all the submitted tasks will be executed sequentially. Method : Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
Cached Thread Pool : A thread pool that creates as many threads it needs to execute the task in parrallel. The old available threads will be reused for the new tasks. If a thread is not used during 60 seconds, it will be terminated and removed from the pool. Method : Executors.newCachedThreadPool()
Fixed Thread Pool : A thread pool with a fixed number of threads. If a thread is not available for the task, the task is put in queue waiting for an other task to ends. Method : Executors.newFixedThreadPool()
Scheduled Thread Pool : A thread pool made to schedule future task. Method : Executors.newScheduledThreadPool()
Single Thread Scheduled Pool : A thread pool with only one thread to schedule future task. Method : Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()

Callable and Future

Runnable interface doesn't return anything after execution(void run).
Callable interface is required whenever we need to retrieve an object after execution of a thread.
Callable<V> is a generic interface with a
V call() method.
submit a callable implementation returns a future object.
Future future = service.submit(myCallable); //myCallable is implementing Callable interface.

Like optional, you can get the object using future.get() method. The get method can throw
InterruptedException, CancellationException, ExecutionException.
